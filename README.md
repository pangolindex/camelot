# Overview

Pangolin Academy is a permissionless dApp that will allow DeFi projects to submit tasks for users to complete and be rewarded with tokens

This project is heavily influenced by [Rabbit](https://app.rabbithole.gg/quests)

This is a community governed project and as such anyone can contribute to it and share in it's success.

I will keep a running list of open tasks within the Issues list and update them there accordingly.

# Functionality

We will have the following major features:

- Skills
- Projects

Let's talk through an example workflow

- Justin connects to Pangolin Academy using Metamask
- He navigates to Projects and adds Pangolin
- He then transfer 50,000 PNG to the Academy
- He then goes to Skills and adds a new Skill "Pool"
- He then adds a Task "Create a Liquidity Pool" and assigns 10 PNG per completed task and the task expires in 3 months
- Sarju now logs onto "Pangolin Academy"
- He can now see the "Pool" Skill there. He clicks it and then see's the "Create Liquidity Pool" task
- He reads the description and performs the task on [https://app.pangolin.exchange](https://app.pangolin.exchange)
- He then comes back to "Pangolin Academy" and then clicks "Verify task" and it should mark it as successful
- He can now claim his 10 PNG reward
